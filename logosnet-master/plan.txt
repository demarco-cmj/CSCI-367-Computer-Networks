1. For this final assignment we have been asked to create a virtual chat
room for active participants and observers using the techniques learned from
the previous assignments. One of the largest differences however is that the
communication between the server and connected clients will not be in a scripted
order. We have decided to follow along with the professor's announcement and 
implement the server using Select() in order to better handle multiple clients 
at once. 

2. The most challenging part of this assignment will be modifying our
previous code such that the server is prepared to receive any type of message 
at any time from up to 510 unique users. We will not be able to hard-code the
send and recv sequences in the same manner as the previous two assignments.

3. Class lecture material, the book, and internet resources such as GeeksForGeeks.
