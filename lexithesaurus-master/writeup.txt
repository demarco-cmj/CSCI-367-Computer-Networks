2. As far as we know, our project does not have any bugs that would cause for major concern. The gameplay runs smoothly.
The one thing we could not figure out is in the server, receiving didn't work the same as the client.
The server kept receiving a bunch of garbage when nothing was being sent. We couldn't get around that, other
than reading 1024 bytes into our buffer.
3. The way we tested that our code was working was by running multiple games. We tested the edge cases, such as
two letter words and words with two or more of the same letters in them. We made sure either client could win, we made sure the correct 
output was being displayed, etc. 
4. The most challenging aspect was receiving on the client's side. The way we had our receive function set up in the previous
assignment would not work for this one, since multiple pieces of information were to be received in different recv()s. We also
were overwriting the buffer with each recv() call, not updating the buffer with each iteration of the loop.
At first, the client was receiving all of the multiple send()s from the server (almost) all at once. So we edited our recv_input()
function to ensure that it would not read farther than the number of bytes specified by the first element in the buffer.
