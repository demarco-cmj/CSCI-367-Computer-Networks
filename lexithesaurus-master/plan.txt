1. Similar to the previous assignment, this program requires us to establish a
client-server connection that sends simple messages back and forth. The game, however,
is no longer hangman, and instead requires two players to attempt to make words from
letters on the board until one play misspells or runs out of time. A round starts with 
one of the two players going first(alternating depending on round number) and given a
designated amount of time to create a word found in the dictonary. The players take turns
guessing and cannot repeat words. First player to three rounds wins.
2. The most challenging will be coding around two different clients. We have ideas on how 
to implement it, but it won't be as easy as it is in our heads. Also, implementing the trie
tree will be difficult. We will need to study it closely to make sure we use it efficiently.
3. Class discord, the lecture slides, and the book.
4. We want to use the GeeksForgeeks implementation of a trie.
5.We plan to meet 9-12 AM on weekdays starting 7/6/21.
